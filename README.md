# vphas_mosaics

These scripts work assuming a request for a ~complete VPHAS+ pointing has been requested from CASU (http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/vstsp/).
ie. There must be two u, r (red block), r (blue block), i exposures, and three g and NB exposures.


The scripts download the files, process them, then create a mosaicked image using Montage. (Note: Montage must be installed)


Run full_mosaic.py (which calls the other scripts when needed) and go from there.
